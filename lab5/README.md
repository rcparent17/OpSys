### Lab 5 - Reilly Parent

This lab contains one program:
* `multi_thread.c`
    * This program takes 1 - 20 integers as command line arguments, and then launches threads to calculate the average, median, minimum, and maximum of all the numbers. 

A simple run of this command looks like:

```bash
reillycparent@penguin:~/workspace/opsys/lab5$ ./multi_thread 1 9 10 4 3
Thread 1 -> The average value is 5
Thread 2 -> The minimum value is 1
Thread 3 -> The maximum value is 10
Thread 4 -> The median  value is 4
```
