This lab is a modified version of the xv6 Operating System.
Running any command will run that command, but will also print out the different process IDs selected by the scheduler function while the processors are running.
This lab also implemented `ps`, which you can run from the command line to get a list of all the runnable, running, and sleeping processes.
